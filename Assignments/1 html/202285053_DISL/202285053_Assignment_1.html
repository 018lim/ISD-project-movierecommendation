					Six Flags Entertainment Corporation is the biggest corporation of amusement parks in the world. It was founded in 1961 in Texas, USA.
					Something not all people know is that the name of Six Flags doesn't come from the number of countries where Six Flags works, but comes
					 the number of waving flags which have been in Texas, from Spain to the USA.

						The appearance of Six Flags in Mexico was not instantaneous. At the end of 1982, an amusement park named Reino Aventura was opened in the
						south part of Mexico City. This park was famous for some of its attractions and, also, for Keiko, the famous killer whale which appeared in
						the movie <i>Free Willy</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						After a remodeling and big changes, in 1992 it was reopened with a new name: Nuevo Reino Aventura (New Adventure kingdom in english) but, due
						to an accident, the owners of the park decided to close it. Nonetheless, in 1999, Reino Aventura was bought for 59 million dolars by Premier Parks,
						the owner of Six Flags and after another remodeling and the creation of new attractions, the park was reopen in 2000 under the name
						<i>Six Flags México</i>.

				<h3  style="margin-left:2rem;" id="WM">ii. Why Mexico?</h3>
				<p style="padding-left:2.5rem;">
					According to some interviews to the last owners of <i>Premier Parks</i>, they were interested in small parks which have already build some attractions so
					they do not have to put a lot of invest in new attractions.
				</p>
				<p style="padding-left:2.5rem;">
					At this moment, Six Flags Mexico is the largest amusement park in latinamerica and one of the most important theme parks in Mexico.

					As we can see, Six Flags Mexico has some attractions which can be considered as extreme. <i>Superman: El Último Escape</i> and <i>Crazanity</i> are
					considered as the fasetes attractions in the park, and <i>Super Girl Sky Flight</i> is the highest attraction in the park.

				<div style="padding-left:2.5rem;">
					<p>
						I have visited Six Flags Mexico more than twice since I have memory. I have created a lot of memories there with family and friends and I have seen
						the park change through the years. From my point of view, is not that expensive and you can have fun in almost all the attractions in one day.
						Nevertheless, it is common to find a lot of people inside the park, so the experience may be not the mos comfortable due to the crowd and the food
						is the only thing thatis expensive (for me).<br>
						The park has more pros than cons so I recomend you to go early and during weekdays to enjoy what Six Flags Mexico has to offer.
