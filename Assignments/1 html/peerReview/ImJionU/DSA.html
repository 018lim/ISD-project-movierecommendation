	<dt><h3>Identifiers</h3></dt>
	<dd>Identifiers in Python are case-sensitive, so 'temperature' and 'Temperature' are distinct names.</dd>
	<dd>Identifiers can be composed of almost any combination of letters, numerals, and underscore characters.</dd>
	<dd>An identifier cannot begin with a numeral</dd> 
	
    <dt><h3>Types</h3></dt>
	<dd>Python is a dynamically typed language, as there is no advance declaration associating an identifier with a particular data type.</dd>
	<dd>An identifier can be associated with any type of object, and it can later be reassigned to another object of the same (or different) type.</dd>
	<dd>Although an identifier has no declared type, the object to which it refers has a definite type.</dd> 

	<dt><h3>Objects</h3></dt>
	<dd>Python is an object-oriented language.</dd>
	<dd>To instantiate an object we usually invoke the constructor of a class:</dd>
    <dd> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;          w = Widget() </dd>
	<br>
	<dd>If the constructor does require parameters, we might use a syntax such as</dd>
    <dd> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;          w = Widget(a,b,c) </dd>

  <d1>
	<dt><h3>List</h3></dt>
	<dd> A list instance stores a sequence of objects, that is, a sequence of references (or pointers) to objects in the list.</dd>
	<dd> Elements of a list may be arbitrary objects (including the None object).</dd>
	<dd> Python uses the characters [ ] as delimiters for a list literal.</dd>
    
	<dt><h3>Tuple</h3></dt>
	<dd>The tuple class provides an immutable (unchangeable) version of a sequence, which allows instances to have an internal representation that may be more streamlined than that of a list.</dd>
	<dd>To express a tuple of length one as a literal, a comma must be placed after the element, but within the parentheses. </dd>
	<dd>Python uses the characters ( ) as delimiters for a tuple literal.</dd>
	
	<dt><h3>Dict</h3></dt>
	<dd>Python's dict class represents a dictionary, or mapping, from a set of distinct keys to associated values.</dd>
	<dd>A nonempty dictionary is expressed using a comma-separated series of key:value pairs.</dd>
	<dd>For example, the dictionary {'ge':'German'} maps 'ge' to 'German'.</dd>

	<dt><h3>Break</h3></dt>
	<dd> Python supports a break statement that immediately terminate a while or for loop when executed within its body.</dd>
	<dt><h3>Continue</h3></dt>
	<dd> Python also supports a continue statement that causes the current iteration of a loop body to stop, but with subsequent passes of the loop proceeding as expected.</dd>
	
    
	<dt><h3>Simple Output</h3></dt>
	<dd>The built-in function, print, is used to generate standard output to the console.</dd>
	<dd>In its simplest form, it prints an arbitrary sequence of arguments, separated by spaces, and followed by a trailing newline character. </dd>
	<dt><h3>Simple Input</h3></dt>
	<dd>The primary means for acquiring information from the user console is a built-in function named input.</dd>
	<dd>This function displays a prompt, if given as an optional parameter, and then waits until the user enters some sequence of characters followed by the return key.</dd>
